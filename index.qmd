# Introduction 

This website is a catalogue of publications from the open access publishers in the [ScholarLed](https://scholarled.org/) consortium (Mattering Press, meson press, Open Book Publishers, punctum books, African Minds, and mediastudies.press). It's an example of constructing a dynamic computational publication using a workflow of Jupyter Notebook files, Python code, and [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) technical publishing software.

All bibliographic metadata is retrieved from [Thoth](https://thoth.pub/), an open metadata management and dissemination system for open access books designed as part of the [COPIM project](https://www.copim.ac.uk/).
